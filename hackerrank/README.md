#  [HackerRank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HackerRank)

When I'm in the process of understanding and solving a challenge, I usually use my own [IDE](https://www.willianantunes.com/about#software), mainly because I like to write tests and assert that what I think is correct.

HackerRank has a feature called "test against custom input". It's excellent and sufficient to test your code on the platform. Still, developers write tests in a professional environment, so if you're not in a hurry, do it too.
